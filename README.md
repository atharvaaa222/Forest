# Stock Price Prediction

## Project Description
Implemented a stock price prediction model using machine learning techniques and technical indicators. The project utilized historical stock price data obtained from Yahoo Finance and calculated various technical indicators such as Average Directional Index (ADX), Average True Range (ATR), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BBANDS), and Momentum (MOM). A Random Forest Regression model was trained on the features extracted from the technical indicators to predict the next day's closing price of the stock.
